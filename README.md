# Basics-Of-DSA

Till now in this project , topics that are done are:

1)Basic Maths and Arrays:
-Prefix sum, modulo, prime numbers, 
-Arrays: traversal, sorting, searching
From this I am able to implement and solve array-based problems with confidence.

2)Strings and recursion:
-String manipulation and pattern problems
-Recursion and backtracking fundamentals
From this I am pretty confident with recursion flow ,common string patterns and recursive thinking and able to solve basic backtracking problems.

Resources used were :
1]GeeksforGeeks DSA practise
2]Mock problem sets provided weekly
3]Youtube playlist for DSA in C++.
